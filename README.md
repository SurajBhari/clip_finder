Basic self hosted website based application to find when a specific word or term was said in a livestream chat
</br>
Will not process anything that was not a livestream. or is not rendered fully by youtube yet.
</br>

I am currently hosting this myself [here](http://suraj1436.site:8080/). but it is easy to host yourself 
</br>

A video showcasing this would be up soon. 
# Steps
