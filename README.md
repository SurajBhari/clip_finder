# clip_finder

Basic self hosted website based application to find when a specific word or term was said in a livestream chat
</br>
Will not process anything that was not a livestream. or is not rendered fully by youtube yet.
</br>

I am currently hosting this myself [here](http://surajbhari.info:8080/). but it is easy to host yourself 
</br>

A video showcasing this would be up soonâ„¢. 
# Steps
```pip install -r requirements.txt```</br>

```python main.py```
